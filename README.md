# Go-To Definition Plugin for Gedit 3

This plug-in will allow user to jump to the definition of the identifier selected and highlight it.

Parts of this plugin are based on the work of [Masatoshi Tsushima](https://github.com/utisam/gtagJump)

![Demo 1](http://share.gifyoutube.com/KRbDoq.gif)


## Requirements

The plugin requires `exuberant-ctags` to be installed on the system.

To install [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) on Ubuntu, use the following command:
	
		sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags

The plug-in was developed and tested for *Gedit 3.14*

## Installation

- Download the archive on your computer

- Extract the files.

- Open a terminal window and navigate to the extracted folder.

- Type `sh install.sh` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and you're good to go.

## Usage

- Go to the menu and click on Select Root Folder (this can be your project folder which contains all your related files)

- Open any file which belongs to your Root Folder (or Project folder) and right click on any identifier. If the context menu shows the **Go-To Definition** option, then click on it and it will take you to the definition of the identifier. 

- Alternatively you can press <kbd>Ctrl+F1</kbd> on the identifier and it will do the same.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

- *To select root folder*: <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + O</kbd>
- *To check your current root folder*: <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + C</kbd>
- *To check your current root folder*: <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + R</kbd>
- *To go to the definition of an identifier*: <kbd>Ctrl+F1</kbd>

## Languages Supported

This plug-in supports all the languages supported by Exuberant Ctags. But, full fledge functionality may not be available for all. It should work well for C, Python, C++, Ruby. Although the plug-in is being tested exhaustively and it will soon work for all supported languages.

## Known Issues

- When selecting from multiple matches, the numeric keypad's <kbd>Enter</kbd> key doesn't work
- Certain kinds of tags are not generated by ctags. Hence, navigating to those isn't possible.

If you come across any issue, then please report it.
